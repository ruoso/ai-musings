# Uninformed musings on artificial intelligence

### 1
My main hypothesis is that intelligence is just an elaborate emergent behavior from contained complexity.
### 2
Complexity by itself is sufficient to generate emergent behavior, but it’s the self-contained nature of the brain that gives emergence to the specific behavior that we call intelligence.
### 3
A true artificial intelligence would not be “useful” in the same sense that specialized artificial intelligences are. For it would be subject to the same limitations that our human minds have.

### 1
On the book 2001 - A Space Odyssey, HAL suffers from a psychotic breakdown. I share the understanding that a true AI would necessarily develop a sense of self. Once a sense of self  develops, there’s no longer control over its actions.
### 2
In that sense, “training” an Artificial Intelligence in the way that specialized neural networks are trained will, in absolute terms, preclude the development of true intelligence.
### 3
True intelligence comes not from the ability to predict the future or even generate data based on past input. True Intelligence depends on the emergence of a behavior that for an external observer emulates what we consider a sense of self.
### 4
Instead of external training, true intelligence needs hints from the connections with the outside world. There is a deep correlation between the physical layout of the brain and the cognitive development.
### 5
Natural reflexes are the bootstrap mechanism of our brain.
### 6
For the bootstrap to happen, not only external input is necessary, but the neural network must receive its own outputs as inputs as well.
### 7
A natural reflex is a physical configuration of the brain that makes a reaction from a given input disproportionately likely, such as, the touch of the cheek triggering the sucking behavior in human newborn babies. I hypothesize that there is a very easy path for synapses generated from the neurons receiving the sense of touch in the cheek to the mechanism responsible for the sucking behavior.
### 7
Natural reflexes will, eventually, be overridden by more complex inputs and the more complex outputs experienced by the brain.
### 8
That override depends on the sucking behavior to also be fed as an input, such that eventually stronger reinforcements, such as the coupling of the mouth with the breast, and the overall discovery of the mouth by the baby will completely override that initial pathway traced by the early reflex.
### 9
A lot of the complex mechanisms of our bodies are actually not happening inside the brain. Recent research has shown that the entire process of walking and running happens entirely in the spinal chord with a single input from the brain representing how fast to go.
### 10
I hypothesize that other complex behaviors, specially automated ones, are also happening outside of the brain, with simpler dimensional controls from the brain, instead of having every aspect of those behaviors micromanaged from the brain.
